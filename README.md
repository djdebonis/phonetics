Spanish phonetics system

## Spaanish Phonetics and Phonology
Spanish is a language with extraordinarily consistent phonetic and phonological patterns. Unlike English, someone who is confident with the systems of the language could be presented with an unknown word, yet they would have no problem pronouncing it because these systems are governed by relatively strict rules. Not only could this person tell you the sound of each allophone, but they could also tell you where the syllable breaks are, as well as how specific allophones combine to be realized as other allophones. Even the dialects of Spanish are often very predictable, for thestill follow the core rules.

The benefit of these consistent systems is not only ease-of-pronunciation, but also a degree of predictability.
